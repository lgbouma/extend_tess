Sizes and ages of known transiting planets.  Systems younger than one gigayear
with ages measured more precisely than a factor of two are emphasized, and were
retrieved from the NASA Exoplanet Archive on 22 Nov 2021.  The majority of
these planets are in open clusters and young stellar associations.  In the
published literature, TESS has already doubled the number of such systems.
Note that starspot-induced variability makes it more difficult to detect the
smallest planets around the youngest stars.
