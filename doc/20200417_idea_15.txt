This is the same as idea 14,
* year 3: south (being executed)
* year 4-5.25: north + ecl.

5 sectors on ecliptic.

But it corrects for the "northern" pointings from scattered light in both the
primary and extended mission.  (as in S14-S16 and S24-S26).

And it omits the small "shift" in longitude/latitude to mitigate the chip gap,
because this is primarily just a visualization exercise and doing the shift is
annoying.

It does this in S40-S42, and also S50-S55.  Note S40-S42 and S53-S55 are the
"S14-S16" analogs, while S50-S52 is the "S24-S26" analog. This can be seen by
adding multiples of 13.
