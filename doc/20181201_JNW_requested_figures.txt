DESCRIPTION:

Some figures were requested by Winn to decide between extended mission
strategies ("idea 1, ecliptic + hemi", vs "idea 4, ecliptic + C3PO", mainly).

LEGEND:

"-" means it's done.
"~" is a reference to the name of the appropriate plot.
"LB" prefaces a comment by yours truly.
"*" means it's not yet done, because I didn't have the appropriate data.
"X" means I didn't think it was necessarily the thing we wanted for deciding on
the observing strategy.

- Radius/period diagram:
 - TESS Prime planets in blue
 - TESS Extended planets in red (solid symbol for multi-transiting systems)

- Radius/insolation diagram
 - TESS Prime in blue
 - TESS Extended in red
   ~ radius_insolation_diagram.png

- Number of simulated planets in the Prime Mission:
  - Bar chart of total, with SNR>10 and Ntransits >= 1
    ~ number_of_detections_vs_plradius_barchart.png has SNR>10, and Ntransits >=3. The
      Ntransits >=1 output from Tom's simulations haven't yet been run.

  - around stars brighter than T=10 (to compare with progress so far)
    ~ number_of_detections_vs_plradius_barchart_Tmaglt10.png

  * for which only 1 transit is detected
    LB: not currently available (see above), but... I'm also not convinced
        that we need this for decision making.

  - vs number of transits
    ~ number_of_detections_vs_ntra_barchart.png

  - which are part of multitransiting systems
    ~ justmultis_number_of_detections_vs_plradius_barchart.png

  - which are in the HZ
    ~ number_of_detections_vs_insolation_barchart.png

  * around stars with transit spectroscopy metric exceeding that of some
      nominal planet (perhaps LHS 1140b)
    LB: we should perhaps have Drake do this -- he has the up-to-date JWST
    noise model.  (And the metric could be "SNR for the entire detection of
    water vapor" as he suggested)

- Number of planets found in the EM
  - Total New Planets, with SNR>10 and Ntransits >= 1
    ~ number_of_detections_vs_plradius_barchart.png has SNR>10, and Ntransits >=3. The
      Ntransits >=1 output from Tom's simulations aren't yet available.

  - New Planets found due to increased SNR relative to Prime
  - New Planets found in regions of sky that Prime did not observe
    ~ new_planets_newsky_or_snrboost_vs_plradius.png

  - Planets for which Prime detected 1 transit and Extended detects more
  - Planets for which Prime detected 2 transits and Extended detects more

- Concatenating the Prime and Extended, what is the total fraction of the sky
  that is covered by TESS?

  - Did this by using LB's sky-mapping code. Associated skymaps are at
    `/results/visualize_survey_designs/merged_with_primary`.

  - Then ask: what fraction of the randomly distributed points got at least 1
    observation?

    idea_1_SN_ecliptic_coords_observed_merged.csv --- 87.52% of sky observed
    idea_2_SNSNS_hemi_coords_observed_merged.csv --- 79.80% of sky observed
    idea_3_SNNSN_hemi_coords_observed_merged.csv --- 79.80% of sky observed
    idea_4_ecliptic_and_C3PO_quarters_coords_observed_merged.csv --- 88.94% of sky observed
    idea_5_ecliptic_and_C3PO_quarters_thru_EM2yr1_coords_observed_merged.csv --- 89.28% of sky observed
    idea_6_ecliptic_and_C3PO_quarters_thru_EM2yr2_coords_observed_merged.csv --- 89.62% of sky observed

* Improvement in ability to predict transit times in 2022
  * for HZ planets
  * other cases?
  
  LB: to do this calculation, you need to know if the planet is detected in
  "postage stamps" or "full frame images". (This affects the precision with
  which you measure the midtime).
