% Young planets are important

While thousands of transiting planets are known, most of them orbit
stars that are between 1 and 10 billion years old.  This is a
challenge for studies of planet evolution, because most evolutionary
processes happen either during ($<$$10^7$ years) or shortly after disk
dispersal ($<$$10^8$ years).  For example, the mini-Neptune planets
discovered by Kepler with sizes between 2 and 4 $R_\oplus$ are thought
to have been a factor of a few larger during their first one hundred
million years ({\it e.g.}, Owen \& Wu 2016).  They then shrunk as they
lost their primordial atmospheres of hydrogen and helium gas to
different forms of heating.  Age is also a relevant variable for the
hot Jupiters: in the long-standing debate regarding which of the
disk-migration or high-eccentricity migration formation pathways are
more effective, the latter predicts a dearth of very young hot
Jupiters, which is consistent with the current data.  In the much
closer context of the Solar System, the Moon itself is thought to have
formed during an era of giant planetesimal impacts that lasted at
least one hundred million years.

% There's a challenge. But TESS is stepping up to the plate.

While young stars and young planets have much to teach us, the stars
themselves are rare, and they are also photometrically variable.  TESS
is playing a major role both in finding new young stars, and also in
discovering the young planets that transit them.  Several
collaborations have developed to take advantage of this opportunity.
They include THYME ({\it e.g.}, Newton et al., 2019), PATHOS ({\it
e.g.}, Nardiello et al., 2020), and CDIPS ({\it e.g.}, Bouma et al.,
2020), as well as a number of team who have avoided acronyms.

% Probably the two most important young planet systems yet published
% by TESS.  Ignoring submitted / in prep cases like TOI 1227.

Some major planetary discoveries from TESS include the two
mini-Neptune sized planets found to transit AU Mic, which is one of
the nearest pre-main-sequence stars (Plavchan et al., 2020).  These 22
million year-old planets may be actively losing their atmospheres; the
star also hosts a outer debris disk which contains clumps of dust that
could migrate inward to interact with the inner planetary system.
There is also the 17 million year old Jupiter-sized HIP 67522 b
(Rizzuto et al., 2020).  If it has a Jovian-mass, this Jupiter-sized
planet ($10.4 \pm 0.4\,R_\oplus$) would be a factor of 50\% smaller
than expected given standard planet evolution models (Fortney et al.,
2007, Baraffe et al., 2008).  A more likely explanation is that it has
a lower mass, closer to that of Neptune (17$\,M_\oplus$), but has not
yet lost its puffy primordial atmosphere.

While the size distribution that TESS is measuring of the youngest
planets contains information about planetary atmospheres, new TESS
discoveries are also enabling studies of planetary orbital
architectures.  The main means is through spectroscopic measurements
of the angle between the planet's orbit and the star's spin axis --
the stellar obliquity -- which are only possible because the stars
TESS discovers are so bright.  Hot field stars hosting hot Jupiters
(Winn et al., 2010) and perhaps hosting smaller planets (Louden et
al., 2020) often have high obliquities.  The obliquities of planets
around cool stars tend to be low, but this could be due to tidal
realignment.  Obliquity measurements for young planets are therefore
important, because they provide a view of the primordial obliquity
distribution.  So far, all of the young close-in planets from TESS
seem to have orbits that are aligned with their stellar spins (Zhou et
al., 2020, Palle et al., 2020, Dai et al., 2020, Heitzmann et al.,
2021).  This is consistent with a quiescent migration history for all
of these systems, and is different than the misaligned orbits seen
around some comparable older systems.  Future TESS discoveries will
increase the number of obliquity measurements for young planets and
will have an outsized impact on our understanding of primordial
planetary orbits, particularly around cool stars where tidal
realignment is most effective.

% Psc-Eri, blind searches, and the FFIs

A separate benefit of the wide sky coverage from TESS is that one can
find planets around stars that were not known to be special ahead of
time.  One prominent example is the Psc-Eri stream.  Using data from
Gaia, Meingast et al., (2019) discovered a nearby stream of co-moving
stars in the galactic disk spread over 400 parsecs.  Gaia alone
however did not enable an accurate measurement of the ages of the
stars.  Light curves from the TESS full frame images enabled Curtis et
al., (2019) to measure stellar rotation periods for stars in the
stream.  Using gyrochronology, this led to a determination that all
these stars were 120 million years old.  Psc-Eri now has over 1000
known members (e.g., Roser & Schilbach 2020). This provides what is
essentially a new Pleiades, at a comparable distance, and with
significantly less crowding.  There are many potential uses in stellar
astrophysics (e.g., Hawkins 2020).  Within exoplanets, TESS discovered
three transiting planets in the Psc-Eri stream (TOI-451; Newton et
al., 2020), while the Pleiades has yet to have any transiting planet
discoveries.  Similar techniques have been applied to discover
entirely new open clusters around TESS planet candidates (TOI-1098;
Tofflemire et al., 2021), and also to characterize the tidal tails of
already known open clusters (Bouma et al., 2021).

The synergy between TESS and all-sky missions including WISE, Gaia,
and e-ROSITA provides a strong reason to expect more exciting
discoveries in the areas of young planets and their host stars.  In
addition to studies aimed at discovering the youngest transiting
planets, the duration and cadence of TESS data enables studies of
stellar angular momentum evolution (via rotation periods), stellar
flaring rates and the associated quantities of high-energy flux
incident on planetary surfaces (e.g., Gilbert et al., 2021), and
stellar evolution through the determination of fundamental parameters
of young eclipsing binaries (e.g., Stassun et al., 2020).
